# Trivia Project

For this project I was tasked with developing a game that could played in a browser using CSS, HTML and Javascript. I developed a trivia game to test basic questions from the US Citizenship test.

## How to Play

Once the game is open in your browser, press the start button.  Each question has four possible answers and only one correct answer.

## How to Win

To win the game, the player must answer 7 out of 10 questions correctly.  If the player fails to win, he/she will be asked to play again
